# BookKeeper - Capstone Project 1

**Year Up United ‚Äì Java Capstone Project 1**  
This is my first capstone project for the Year Up United program. The program is written in **Java** and simulates a simple bookkeeping application. Users can add deposits, make payments, view ledgers, and generate reports.

---

## Features

- **Add Deposit:** Record positive transactions with description, vendor, and amount.  
- **Make Payment:** Record negative transactions with description, vendor, and amount.  
- **Ledger Menu:** View all transactions, only deposits, or only payments.  
- **Reports Menu:** Generate Month-to-Date, Previous Month, Year-to-Date, and Previous Year reports.  
- **Search by Vendor:** Quickly filter transactions by vendor name.  
- **Persistent Storage:** Transactions are saved in a CSV file for long-term storage.

## üí° Functional Highlights

### 1. **Transaction Flow Overview**
Demonstrates the full journey ‚Äî from adding a deposit or payment to seeing it appear instantly in the ledger and saved in transactions.csv. as well as automatic time recordings and date recordings.

### 2. **Error Handling and Validation**
Handles invalid input gracefully (e.g. Entering empty texts, entering text instead of numbers etc).

---

### 5. **Vendor Search with Partial Matches**
Searches for transactions by vendor, supporting partial text (e.g., typing ‚Äúama‚Äù returns *Amazon* and *Amanda‚Äôs Shop*).

---

### 5. **Sorted Transactions**
Transactions are automatically sorted by newest date and time (descending order), so recent activity always appears first.



---

### 6. **Data Persistence**
All data remains stored even after the program is closed, thanks to the `saveEachTransaction()` method writing to `transactions.csv`.
