# BookKeeper - Capstone Project 1

**Year Up United ‚Äì Java Capstone Project 1**  
This is my first capstone project for the Year Up United program. The program is written in **Java** and simulates a simple bookkeeping application. Users can add deposits, make payments, view ledgers, and generate reports.


---

## Project Overview
BookKeeper is a simple yet powerful Java-based bookkeeping application designed to help users easily manage and track their personal or small business transactions. The goal of this project is to demonstrate core Java skills such as file handling, object-oriented programming, and error handling, while also providing a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Add Deposit:** Record positive transactions with description, vendor, and amount.  
- **Make Payment:** Record negative transactions with description, vendor, and amount.  
- **Ledger Menu:** View all transactions, only deposits, or only payments.  
- **Reports Menu:** Generate Month-to-Date, Previous Month, Year-to-Date, and Previous Year reports.  
- **Search by Vendor:** Quickly filter transactions by vendor name.  
- **Persistent Storage:** Transactions are saved in a CSV file for long-term storage.

## üí° Functional Highlights

### 3. **Error Handling and Validation**
Handles invalid input gracefully (e.g. Entering empty texts, entering text instead of numbers etc).

### 5. **Vendor Search with Partial Matches**
Searches for transactions by vendor, supporting partial text (e.g., typing ‚Äúama‚Äù returns *Amazon* and *Amanda‚Äôs Shop*).

### 5. **Sorted Transactions**
Transactions are automatically sorted by newest date and time (descending order), so recent activity always appears first.
